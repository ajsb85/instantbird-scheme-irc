The IRC channel links require an external IRC client associated with the IRC format links (of the form irc://irc.server.net:port/channel?key), in order to run it and automatically join the selected channel.
Under Ubuntu you need to install (if not already installed) only xchat and xchat-remote packages.
Probably in other Linux distributions you need the same packages, but at the moment, I have no means of checking this.
Under MacOS X and Windows you simply need an IRC client handling the IRC protocol (like Colloquy for MacOS X and XChat2 [silverex build, maybe starting from the next build] for Windows, among those freeware).
Under MacOS X, the menus in the menu bar and in the Tools menu, will not show link icons although the icons will be shown correctly in the right-click context menu.
